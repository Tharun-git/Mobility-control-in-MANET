# Mobility-control-in-MANET

One of the challenges in the MANET is the evaluation and design of an ef-
fective Mobility Control protocol that works at low data rates and responds to
dynamic changes in the network topology for different Mobility Models. Sev-
eral ad hoc protocols have been designed for accurate, fast, reliable routing for
a high volume of changeable network topology. Such protocols must deal with
the typical limitations of changeable network topology, which include high power
consumption, low bandwidth, and high error rates.


In this paper, we proposed a new mobility control algorithm for improved
route availability in highly dynamic safety critical environment where the ad-hoc
nodes may potentially move out of range from others. The Ad-hoc network is
divided into clusters and a cluster head is selected from each cluster periodically
using weighted cluster algorithm. Using extreme machine learning approach,
these cluster heads predict the trajectories of all the nodes in its cluster and run
mobility control function for all those nodes that may move out of range from
other nodes. This mobility control function updates the future mobility states
of the selected node. The simulation results report that the proposed approach
yield better performance than state of art approaches.
